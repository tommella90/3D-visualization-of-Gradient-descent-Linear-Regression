# VISUALIZATION OF GRADIENT DESCENT - LINEAR REGRESSION
### This is a 3d visualization of the Gradient Descent in Linear regression
I used Touchdesigner to plot the cartesian spaces and the 3d space.

[video]

Choose the parameters
- possibile range of the slope
- possible range of the intercept 
- number of sample (0-100)

Press PLAY and watch the gradient adjusting to the data
Press RESET to reset the data and start a new video


### If you want to try it: 
- clone the repo 
```
git clone https://github.com/tommella90/Gradient-descent-Linear-Regression
```
- create a conda env called td_py (necessary for touchdesigner): 
```
conda create -n td_py python=3.9
```
- and run the requirements:
```
pip install requirements.txt
